# @grimoirelabs/core

## 0.3.0

### Minor Changes

- 7355939: Implement VM real-data and runtime alignment features.

  For `@grimoirelabs/cli`:

  - Add `--data-replay`, `--data-max-age`, and `--on-stale` to `simulate` and `cast`.
  - Add unified run reporting with `Run`, `Data`, `Events`, and `Bindings` blocks.
  - Add JSON run envelopes that include machine-readable provenance.
  - Enforce stale-data policy (`fail|warn`) and replay resolution by run ID or snapshot ID.
  - Persist provenance metadata into state-backed run records.

  For `@grimoirelabs/core`:

  - Extend run records with optional provenance metadata.
  - Persist and load provenance in `SqliteStateStore` (with schema migration support).
  - Keep `createRunRecord` compatible while allowing provenance attachment.

## 0.2.0

### Minor Changes

- 15c805b: Add Pi-backed advisory execution with auto model resolution and deterministic replay.

  - CLI: enable advisory by default when a model is configured (spell, CLI flags, or Pi defaults), keep `--advisory-pi` as force mode, and add replay-first resolution behavior.
  - Core: extend advisory handler interfaces for step-level traceability (`stepId`, `emit`) and emit advisory/tool trace ledger events for audit and replay.
  - Docs/skills: clarify VM vs deterministic runtime and document the exploration -> record -> replay -> execute workflow.
